# Account Deletion Implementation - Apple Compliance

## Overview
This implementation adds account deletion functionality to comply with Apple App Store guidelines (5.1.1 - Account Sign-In). Users can now delete their accounts and all associated data directly from within the app.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. AccountDeletionService (`src/services/accountDeletionService.ts`)
**Purpose:** Centralized service to handle complete account deletion with proper database cleanup

**Features:**
- `deleteAgentAccount()` - Deletes agent and all associated data
- `deleteOwnerAccount()` - Deletes owner and all associated data
- `confirmAccountDeletion()` - Shows confirmation dialog with warnings

**Data Deletion Process:**

#### For Agents:
1. Delete all proposals sent by the agent
2. Delete property view history
3. Delete agent profile
4. Delete user_auth record
5. Delete authentication user

#### For Owners:
1. Get all properties owned by the owner
2. Delete all proposals for those properties
3. Delete property view history
4. Delete all properties
5. Delete owner profile
6. Delete user_auth record
7. Delete authentication user

### 2. Agent Profile Screen (`src/screens/agent/AgentProfileScreen.tsx`)
**Added:**
- Import of `AccountDeletionService`
- `handleDeleteAccount()` function
- "Eliminar Cuenta" button (dark red color)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Success/error handling

**Button Location:** Bottom of actions section, after "Cerrar Sesión"

### 3. Owner Profile Screen (`src/screens/owner/OwnerProfileScreen.tsx`)
**Added:**
- Import of `AccountDeletionService`
- `handleDeleteAccount()` function
- "Eliminar Cuenta" button (dark red color)
- Confirmation dialog before deletion
- Success/error handling

**Button Location:** Bottom of actions section, after "Cerrar Sesión"

## User Flow

### Account Deletion Process:
```
1. User opens Profile Screen (Agent or Owner)
2. Scrolls to bottom of actions section
3. Clicks "Eliminar Cuenta" button
4. Sees confirmation dialog with:
   - Warning about permanent deletion
   - List of data that will be deleted
   - "Cancelar" and "Eliminar" options
5. If confirmed:
   - Shows "Eliminando cuenta..." message
   - Deletes all associated data
   - Shows success message
   - Redirects to login screen
6. If cancelled:
   - Dialog closes, no action taken
```

## Confirmation Dialog Content

### Agent Account:
```
⚠️ Eliminar Cuenta

Esta acción eliminará permanentemente tu cuenta de agente, incluyendo:

• Tu perfil
• Todas tus propuestas
• Tu historial de vistas
• Toda tu información personal

Esta acción no se puede deshacer.

```

### Owner Account:
```

## Database Tables Affected

### Agent Deletion:
- `proposals` - All proposals by agent
- `property_views` - Agent's view history
- `agents` - Agent profile
- `user_auth` - User authentication record
- `auth.users` - Supabase auth user

### Owner Deletion:
- `proposals` - All proposals for owner's properties
- `property_views` - Views on owner's properties
- `properties` - All properties owned
- `owners` - Owner profile
- `user_auth` - User authentication record
- `auth.users` - Supabase auth user

## Security & Data Privacy

### ✅ Compliant Features:
1. **User Control** - Users can delete their own accounts
2. **Complete Deletion** - All user data is permanently removed
3. **Clear Warning** - Users understand what will be deleted
4. **Confirmation Required** - Prevents accidental deletion
5. **Immediate Effect** - Data deleted immediately upon confirmation
6. **No Recovery** - Clearly states action is irreversible

### Data Retention:
- **No data retained** after deletion
- **No soft delete** - hard delete from database
- **Cascading deletion** - all related data removed
- **Auth removal** - user cannot log in after deletion

## Technical Implementation

### Error Handling:
- Try-catch blocks for all database operations
- User-friendly error messages
- Fallback to sign out if auth deletion fails
- Console logging for debugging

### Cleanup Process:
1. **Database cleanup** - Remove all records
2. **Form data cleanup** - Clear cached form data
3. **Auth cleanup** - Sign out and delete auth user
4. **Navigation** - Redirect to login screen

### Button Styling:
```typescript
deleteButton: {
  backgroundColor: '#CC0000',  // Dark red for danger action
}
```

## Important Notes

### Database Permissions:
Make sure your Supabase RLS (Row Level Security) policies allow users to delete their own data:
- Users should be able to delete their own profile
- Users should be able to delete their own proposals
- Owners should be able to delete their own properties
- Cascade deletes should work properly

### Admin Delete User:
The `supabase.auth.admin.deleteUser()` method requires admin privileges. If this fails, the service falls back to signing out the user. You may need to:
1. Use a server-side function for auth user deletion
2. Or handle it through Supabase database triggers
3. Or use the Supabase Management API

### Alternative Implementation:
If `admin.deleteUser()` doesn't work in the app, you can:
1. Create a server-side function (Edge Function) to handle auth deletion
2. Call that function from the app
3. Or mark the account as "deleted" and handle cleanup server-side

## Deployment Notes

Before submitting to Apple:
1. ✅ Account deletion implemented
2. ✅ Confirmation dialog added
3. ✅ Complete data removal
4. ⚠️ Test on real accounts (not just test data)
5. ⚠️ Verify database permissions allow deletion
6. ⚠️ Test that deleted users cannot log back in
7. ⚠️ Ensure no orphaned data remains

## Support

If you encounter issues with `admin.deleteUser()`, let me know and I can help implement a server-side solution using Supabase Edge Functions.

For questions about database cleanup or RLS policies, I can help configure those as well.
